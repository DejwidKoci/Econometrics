# Microeconomic Functions of Demand
Microeconomic demand functions express regularities of the development of demand by individual consumers (or households) as a function of income level, 
demographic and other consumer characteristics (e.g. place of residence, education).
Macroeconomic demand functions measure demand for the population in a larger area (region, country) from:
- the average income for a group of consumers,
- the price of the good in question and other goods


Here we used this functions to describe average monthly consumption of vegetables, fruit, cabanas and fish (apples.py, berries.py, citrus.py, dried.py, vegetables.py, kabanos.py, fish.py) on average monthly real income.



# Functions Describing The Dependence of Demand on Income
Functions are most commonly used to approximate Engel curves:
- power model $Y = aX^b, b>0, a>0$
- exponential with reverse function $Y = exp(a+b\frac{1}{X}), b<0, a>0$
- Tornqvist's functions:
    - for basic goods $Y = \frac{aX}{X + b}, a>0, b>0$
    - for higher-order goods $Y = \frac{a(X - c)}{X + b}, a>0, b>0, c>0$
    - for luxury goods $Y = aX\frac{(X-c)}{X + b}, a>0, b>0, c>0$  

where X is consumer income
