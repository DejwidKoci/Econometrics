 # Tornqvist's Functions:
 Tornqvist functions are used in price analysis, microeconomics and research on price and quantity changes in products. They help determine how consumers and producers respond to price changes and how these changes affect markets and the economy as a whole.  
 We have three types of functions:
  - for basic goods $Y = \frac{aX}{X + b}, a>0, b>0$  
  - for higher-order goods $Y = \frac{a(X - c)}{X + b}, a>0, b>0, c>0$  
  - for luxury goods $Y = aX\frac{(X-c)}{X + b}, a>0, b>0, c>0$    

where $X$ is consumer income.
