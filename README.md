# Econometrics
This project includes exercises that were conducted during econometrics classes. They cover the following topics:

-Examination of outlier observations,
-Investigation of instrumental variables (Hausman, Sargan, and weak instruments tests),
-Estimation of simple, recursive, multivariate, and simultaneous equation models,
-Construction of segmented models and models based on qualitative explanatory variables,
-Construction of logit and probit models,
-Development of nonlinear models (power, exponential, logarithmic),
-Building demand and production function models,
-Study of Tornqvist type I, II, and III functions.

These tasks make use of modules such as pandas, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and statmodels.
