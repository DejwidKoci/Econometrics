# Econometrics 

Welcome to our econometrics exercise project! Here, you'll find a collection of exercises that were conducted during my econometrics classes. These exercises cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Exploring outlier observations
- Investigating instrumental variables (Hausman, Sargan, and weak instruments tests)
- Estimating simple, recursive, multivariate, and simultaneous equation models
- Constructing segmented models and models based on qualitative explanatory variables
- Creating logit and probit models
- Developing various types of nonlinear models (power, exponential, logarithmic)
- Building demand and production function models
- Analyzing Tornqvist type I, II, and III functions

We've leveraged a variety of Python modules to complete these tasks, including:

- pandas
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
